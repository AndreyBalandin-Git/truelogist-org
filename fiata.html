    <h2>FIATA: Legal Validation for eFBL</h2>
    <p>FIATA is the legal owner and standard-setting body behind the electronic FIATA Bill of Lading (eFBL), a document of growing importance in digital trade workflows.</p>
    <p>Truelogist is currently developing a dedicated validation engine designed to assess the legal and structural integrity of eFBL documents across jurisdictions and transaction layers.</p>
    <p>This validation engine will allow stakeholders — from shippers to insurers — to independently verify eFBL authenticity, provenance, and cross-border consistency, using a logic-based framework without relying on proprietary APIs or external declarations.</p>

      <input type="text" placeholder="eFBL Number" />
